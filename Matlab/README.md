# Determining MinSpan vectors

This repository contains code for calculating MinSpan vectors for a COBRA model in the Matlab environment. More info on MinSpan is available at [Bordbar et al. MSB (2014)](http://msb.embopress.org/content/10/7/737).

A MATLAB-generated tutorial for running the calculating MinSpan vectors for the core E. coli model.
